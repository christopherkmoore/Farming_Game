to do's that I think of that are basically a backlog or log for ideas

pool the models?

refactor. I've already made a huge fucking mess.


THINGS I DON'T LIKE:

the viewmodel on the market place is remade every time inventoryChanged fires + reloads entire table view
I want to learn about property observers. (for the viewModels)


hash value of Items is based on subclass accessibility name bad bad bad
